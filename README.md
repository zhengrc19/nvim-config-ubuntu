# Neovim Config (Ubuntu)
This is my personal Neovim config for Ubuntu systems. As a CS undergrad at Tsinghua currently the config is built around course projects, including Python, C/C++, and some Assembly code.

**Current Neovim Version**: 0.7.0

**Current Linux System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on Windows 11 WSL
